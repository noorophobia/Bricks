# Brick Breaker Refactoring Project

This project is part of an assignment for the Software Re-Engineering course at FAST-NU Lahore. The goal was to improve an existing **Brick Breaker game** by applying multiple object-oriented refactoring techniques and design patterns.

## 📈 Objective

Refactor a legacy Brick Breaker game by:
- Improving code structure
- Enhancing readability and maintainability
- Applying design patterns and refactoring techniques

## 🧩 Refactorings Applied

### 🔧 General Improvements

| Class                  | Refactorings Applied                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brick**              | Moved `isCollisionWithBall()` from `GamePanel`                                      |
| **Ball**               | Extracted methods: `loadBallImage()`, `moveBall()`, `checkWallCollisions()`, `updateBallPosition()` |
| **BackgroundImageLabel** | Introduced constants `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`; Extracted `setBackgroundImage()` method     |
| **GamePanel**          | - Replaced type code with state (`LevelManager`)  
                          - Replaced method with method object (`GameStateManager`, `CollisionManager`)  
                          - Replaced constructor with factory (`BrickPatternFactory`)  
                          - Applied Strategy pattern for level design (`LevelOneBrickPattern`, etc.)           |
| **Base**               | Extracted `canMoveLeft()`, `canMoveRight()`; moved `loadBaseImage()` out of constructor |
| **AudioPlayback**      | Extracted common method `playSound()`                                               |

## 🧠 Design Patterns Used

- **Strategy Pattern**:  
  For brick pattern behavior per level (`LevelOneBrickPattern`, `LevelTwoBrickPattern`, ..., `LevelFiveBrickPattern`)

- **Factory Pattern**:  
  Used `BrickPatternFactory` to instantiate different level patterns
